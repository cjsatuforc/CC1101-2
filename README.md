# CC1101
CC1101 Transceiver simple packet oriented driver

The yet another CC1101 library was created with the following goals in mind:
- Ease if use
- Code compactness
- Use radio configuration generated by TI SmartRF studio directly
- Minimum external connection (SPI port only)

It supports variable length packets that should fit onto the transceiver FIFO (max payload size is 60 bytes).
The packet has target address that should match receiver address. The 0 address is used for broadcasting.
The transceiver goes to idle state automatically after packet receive or transmit completion.
